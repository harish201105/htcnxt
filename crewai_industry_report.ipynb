Given the FTC’s concerns that the acquisition breaches anti-trust laws, the imminent court case will be a pivotal moment for Microsoft (via CNBC)\\nMicrosoft’s acquisition plans have received global scrutiny, being approved in China, blocked in the UK, and only approved in the EU with significant caveats.\\nThe acquisition, valued at $68.7 billion, will have significant ramifications for the gaming industry if it goes ahead. As such, the case is to be bought before an internal administrative law judge in the US. The case is set to be heard in August.\\nShould Microsoft fail to convince the court that its acquisition isn’t in breach of US anti-monopoly laws, the tech giant would still have some recourse and would be able to appeal the decision in federal court, in a similar fashion to its ongoing appeal against the UK government’s decision to prevent the acquisition.\\nBoth the EU and the UK’s regulatory bodies identified significant concerns when it came to Microsoft’s share of the cloud gaming market, currently estimated at somewhere around 65% according to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.\\nThough Xbox Game Pass undoubtedly offers great value for money, it would be concerning if Microsoft was able to establish a monopoly in the cloud gaming space. Though Google Stadia and On Live both went the way of the dodo, streaming technology has become sufficiently reliable in recent years as to allow cloud gaming to have a mass market appeal that it’s never previously enjoyed.\\nThe list of best Xbox Game Pass games is intimidatingly long for the likes of Amazon Luna and PlayStation Plus, the latter of which offers its Classics Catalogue to subscribers via the cloud. Hopefully, FTC scrutiny will ensure that, if the acquisition does take place, it’ll occur in a manner that keeps the cloud gaming market open and competitive, rather than allowing it to become Microsoft’s personal fiefdom.\\nTags: cryptoandtech, tech, technews, Technology']}, {'title': 'Microsoft Outs New Russian APT Linked to Wiper Attacks in Ukraine', 'date': neo4j.time.DateTime(2023, 6, 15, 8, 12, 47, 0, tzinfo=<UTC>), 'sentiment': -0.689, 'chunks': ['Microsoft has publicly identified a new APT group called Cadet Blizzard, associated with Russia’s GRU, which has carried out destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine using wiper malware.

In the rest of the story, we’ll cover ways to get the most out of the app.\\nPutting together your whiteboard\\nDrawing on and adding elements to a whiteboard is easy — so easy that whiteboards can quickly become messy and hard to follow. Here are some tips for designing a better whiteboard.\\n1. Use sticky notes for text\\nIf you need to add a lot of text (for example, detailed information to explain an image on your whiteboard), use sticky notes. On the Create toolbar, click Notes, and on the pane that appears, choose a color from the options in the “Notes” section.\\nA sticky note appears as a square card on your whiteboard; inside it, you can type in text. You can change the text style (bold, italic, underline) and the background color of the note.\\nYou can move or resize a note just like any other element on the whiteboard. The size of the text inside the note automatically gets bigger or smaller as you resize the note.\\nCompared to adding text as an element directly on your whiteboard, a sticky note is more visible and more flexible and makes it easier to manage lots of text. As a general rule, adding text as an element directly on the whiteboard works best when you need a headline or just a snippet of text to identify something very briefly.\\n2. Use a note grid for even more text\\nWhen you need to add even more information to your whiteboard, use a note grid. This is a group of sticky notes locked together in a grid layout. Each sticky note inside a note grid can be edited and manipulated like a regular sticky note, such as formatting its text and changing its background color.\\nOn the Create toolbar, click Notes, and on the pane that appears, choose a color from the options in the “Note grids” section. (In the mobile app, click the + icon at the lower right and click Note Grid on the Create panel.) Click Add title at the upper left of the note grid, and then type in a title for the note grid. To add another sticky note to a note grid, click Add Note at the upper right of the grid. An additional, blank note will appear inside the note grid.\\nYou can move or resize a note grid just like any other element on your whiteboard. As you resize a note grid, the sizes of all the sticky notes inside it adjust accordingly.\\nYou can pull any sticky note out from inside a note grid: Select the note, then drag it out of the grid and onto another area of the whiteboard. You can also do the reverse: Drag a sticky note over a note grid, and it will be added to the grid’s group of notes.\\n3. Add multimedia to your whiteboard — judiciously\\nWhiteboard lets you add several multimedia and informational elements, including images, pages from a PDF, slides from a PowerPoint presentation, links to files or web pages, and embedded videos from YouTube or other locations. You can even embed Microsoft Loop components created in Outlook and Teams chat.\\nIt’s fairly obvious how to add images, links, and videos — just click on those icons on the Create panel and follow the instructions that appear. To embed a Loop component, copy it in Outlook or Teams, then right-click on your whiteboard where you want to embed the Loop component and select Paste. To add a page from a PDF or PowerPoint file, select Documents from the Create panel, navigate to the file you want, click Select, select the page(s) or slide(s) you want to add, and click Insert.\\nLike other elements on your whiteboard, you can move and resize all these elements on it.\\nWe suggest exercising restraint, though — only include these media- and information-rich elements when they’re truly useful, and keep the number of them on your whiteboard to a minimum. A whiteboard should convey ideas in a simple way that’s easy to take in quickly, primarily through basic drawings, shapes, and text. Keep in mind that your colleagues may view your whiteboard on the smaller screens of laptops, smartphones, or tablets.\\n4. Start with a template\\nStaring at a blank whiteboard can be daunting. What’s the first thing you should put on it? To help you kickstart things, Microsoft Whiteboard provides more than 60 templates grouped into categories such as “Brainstorming,” “Design and research']}]\u001b[00m\n",

This has attracted interest from leading tech companies Google, Meta, and Microsoft, who aim to revolutionize generative AI, recommender systems, and data processing on an unprecedented scale. This will likely bring improvements to language models like GPT, potentially changing the world for regular users.\\nOne of the key features of Nvidia’s DGX GH200 is that it provides 144 terabytes of shared memory- nearly 500 times more memory than a single Nvidia DGX A100 system. To fully understand how impressive this is, one needs to use terms such as “exaflop,” which is equivalent to a quintillion floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). This is a stark contrast to the 100 teraflops (TFLOPs) achieved by Nvidia’s RTX 4090 when overclocked which equals to one trillion floating-point operations per second (TFLOP).\\nThe computer is powered by Nvidia’s GH200 Grace Hopper superchips and doesn’t require a PCIe connection between the CPU and GPU. The chipsets can work together seamlessly using the NVLink interconnect technology, which allows them to integrate a significant number of high-performance GPUs that are unsuitable for consumer PCs with ARM-based Nvidia Grace CPUs and H100 Tensor Core GPUs. This technology has enabled an impressive leap from eight to 256 chips paving the way for Nvidia’s Helios Supercomputer. Nvidia expects the Helios Supercomputer to be online by the end of the year and will encompass four DGX GH200 systems interconnected with Nvidia’s Quantum-2 InfiniBand.\\nTo share the development of the DGX GH200 with the world, Nvidia has partnered with leading tech companies to explore generative AI workloads. It’s believed that the computational power provided by a single DGX GH200 system is well-suited to advance the training of sophisticated language models. This means that we can expect more powerful AI models, leading to more detailed and accurate text and a wider range of data for training. This could improve cultural understanding, context, coherence, and enable specialized AI chatbots that could replace human labor in specific technology fields. However, this could lead to potential job displacement. Nonetheless, Nvidia’s DGX GH200 will undoubtedly shake things up in the world of AI, furthering Nvidia’s lead over AMD.\\nEditors’ Recommendations\\nFollow Google News\\nReference\\nDenial of responsibility!

To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029\\n2030\\n2031\\n2032\\nLevered FCF ($, Millions)\\nUS$660.2m\\nUS$810.8m\\nUS$886.0m\\nUS$1.01b\\nUS$1.12b\\nUS$1.21b\\nUS$1.28b\\nUS$1.34b\\nUS$1.40b\\nUS$1.44b\\nGrowth Rate Estimate Source\\nAnalyst x6\\nAnalyst x6\\nAnalyst x3\\nAnalyst x1\\nAnalyst x1\\nEst @ 7.60%\\nEst @ 5.95%\\nEst @ 4.80%\\nEst @ 3.99%\\nEst @ 3.43%\\nPresent Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.2%\\nUS$610\\nUS$693\\nUS$700\\nUS$736\\nUS$758\\nUS$754\\nUS$738\\nUS$715\\nUS$687\\nUS$657\\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.0b\\nPS.

        "Building an automated report generation pipeline using agentic flows, Neo4j, and CrewAI offers a glimpse into how LLMs can move beyond simple question-and-answer interactions. By assigning specialized tasks to a suite of agents, and arming them with the right tools, we can orchestrate a dynamic, exploratory workflow that pulls relevant data, processes it, and composes well-structured insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this approach, agents collaborate to uncover key statistics about an industry in a given city, gather the latest news, and synthesize everything into a polished markdown report. This goes to show that LLMs can be deployed in creative, multi-step processes, enabling more sophisticated use cases like automated business intelligence, data-driven content creation, and beyond."
